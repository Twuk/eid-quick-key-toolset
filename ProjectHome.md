This project delivers a JavaCard Applet that mimics the behavior of an eID Card. Of course you cannot duplicate a real eID card as you cannot copy the private keys from one card to another. Besides the JavaCard Applet this project also delivers a simple GUI to initialize blank smart cards using the JavaCard Applet. This project is about delivery of the technology. The distribution model and trust model of such Quick-Key smart cards is out of scope and should be handled by the relying parties that decide on using Quick-Key smart cards.
