<a name="introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>
<blockquote>
Thank you for downloading this release of the 
Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> 2 SDK, Standard Edition. 
The Java&nbsp;2 SDK is a development environment for building applications, 
applets, and components using the Java programming language.  
<p>
The Java 2 SDK includes tools useful for developing and 
testing programs written in the Java programming language and running on 
the Java platform. These tools are designed to be used from the command 
line. Except for the appletviewer, these tools do not provide a graphical user
interface.

<a name="docs"><h2>Java 2 SDK Documentation</h2></a>
<blockquote>
The on-line <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/index.html">Java&nbsp;2 Platform Documentation</a> 
contains API specifications, feature descriptions, developer guides, 
reference pages for SDK tools and utilities, 
demos, and links to related information.  This documentation is also 
available in a download bundle which you can install on your machine.  
To obtain the documentation bundle, see the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/download.html">download page</a>.
<p>
For API documentation, refer to the following sources:
	<ul>
<p><li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/index.html">The Java&nbsp;2 Platform API Specification</a>

<a name=relnotes><h2>Release Notes</h2></a>
<blockquote>

See the <a href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/relnotes.html>Release Notes</a> 
on the Java Software web site for additional  
information pertaining to this release. 
The on-line release notes will be updated as needed, so you should check 
them occasionally for the latest information.

<a name=compatibility><h2>Compatibility</h2></a>
<blockquote>

<p>
See <a href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/compatibility.html>
Compatibility with Previous Releases</a> on the Java Software web site 
for the list of known compatibility issues. Every effort has been made to 
support programs written for previous version of the Java platform. 
Although some 
incompatible changes were necessary, most software should migrate to 
current version with no reprogramming.  Any failure to do so is 
considered a bug, except for a small number of cases where compatibility 
was deliberately broken, as described on our compatibility web page. Some
compatibility-breaking changes were required to close potential
security holes or to fix implementation or design bugs.

<h2>The Java 2 Runtime Environment</h2></a>
<blockquote>
      The Java 2 Runtime Environment is available as a separately 
      downloadable product.  See the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/download.html">download web site</a>.
<p>
      The Java 2 Runtime Environment allows you to run applications  
      written in the Java programming language.  Like the Java 2 SDK, it 
      contains the 
      Java virtual machine, classes comprising the Java 2 Platform API, and 
      supporting files. Unlike the Java 2 SDK, it does not contain 
      development tools such as compilers and debuggers. 
      <p>
      You can freely redistribute the Java 2 Runtime Environment 
      with your application, according to the terms of the Runtime 
      Environment's license. Once you have developed your application using 
      the Java 2 SDK, you can ship it with the Runtime Environment so 
      your end-users will have a Java platform on which to run your 
      software.
</blockquote>


<a name="redistribution"><h2>Redistribution</h2></a>
<blockquote>
The term "vendors" used here refers to licensees, developers, and 
independent software vendors (ISVs) who license and distribute the 
Java 2 Runtime Environment with their programs.

Vendors must follow the terms of the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, 
Binary Code License agreement.


<h3>Required vs. Optional Files</h3>

The files that make up the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, are divided into 
two categories: required and optional.  Optional files may be excluded 
from redistributions of the Java 2 SDK at the 
vendor's discretion.  

The following section contains a list of the files and directories that 
may optionally be omitted from redistributions of the Java 2 SDK.  All 
files not in these lists of optional files must be 
included in redistributions of the Java 2 SDK.


<h3>Optional Files and Directories</h3>

The following files may be optionally excluded from redistributions:
<dl>
<dt><tt>jre/lib/charsets.jar</tt>
   <dd>Character conversion classes
<dt><tt>jre/lib/ext/</tt>              
   <dd><tt>sunjce_provider.jar</tt> - the SunJCE provider for Java 
              Cryptography APIs<br>
       <tt>localedata.jar</tt> - contains many of the resources 
              needed for non US English locales<br>
       <tt>ldapsec.jar</tt> - contains security features supported 
              by the LDAP service provider<br>
       <tt>dnsns.jar</tt> - for the InetAddress wrapper of JNDI DNS 
              provider

</dl>
<p>

In addition, the Java Web Start product may be excluded from redistributions.
Depending on the platform, the Java Web Start 
product is contained in a file named as follows.  The actual
product version number would replace the <tt>&lt;version number&gt;</tt> 
notation.
<blockquote><pre>
javaws-&lt;version number&gt;solaris-sparc-i.zip
javaws-&lt;version number&gt;solaris-i586-i.zip
javaws-&lt;version number&gt;linux-i586-i.zip 
javaws-&lt;version number&gt;windows-i586-i.exe
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Unlimited Strength Java Cryptography Extension</h3>
Due to import control restrictions for some countries, the Java Cryptography 
Extension (JCE) policy files shipped with the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition and 
the Java 2 Runtime Environment allow strong but limited cryptography to be used.
These files are located at:
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
&lt;java-home&gt;/lib/security/local_policy.jar
&lt;java-home&gt;/lib/security/US_export_policy.jar
</pre></blockquote>
where <tt>&lt;java-home&gt;</tt> is the <tt>jre</tt> directory of 
the Java 2 SDK or the top-level directory of the Java 2 Runtime 
Environment.

An unlimited strength version of these files indicating 
no restrictions on cryptographic strengths is available 
on the Java 2 SDK web site for those living in eligible 
countries.  Those living in eligible countries may download 
the unlimited strength version and replace the strong 
cryptography jar files with the unlimited strength files.  

<h3>Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism</h3>

An endorsed standard is a Java API defined through a standards
process other than the Java Community Process(SM) (JCP(SM)). Because
endorsed standards are defined outside the JCP, it is anticipated that
such standards will be revised between releases of the Java 2 
Platform.  In order to take advantage of new revisions to endorsed 
standards, developers and software vendors may use the Endorsed 
Standards Override Mechanism to provide newer versions of an endorsed 
standard than those included in the Java 2 Platform as released by Sun
Microsystems.
<p>
For more information on the Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism, 
including the list of platform packages that it may be used to 
override, see
<blockquote>
   <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/guide/standards/index.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/guide/standards/</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
Classes in the packages listed on that web page may be replaced only 
by classes implementing a more recent version of the API as defined 
by the appropriate standards body.
<p>
In addition to the packages listed in the document at the above 
URL, which are part of the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition 
(J2SE<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup>) specification, 
redistributors of Sun's J2SE 
Reference Implementation are allowed to override classes whose 
sole purpose is to implement the functionality provided by 
public APIs defined in these Endorsed Standards packages.  
Redistributors may also override classes in the <tt>org.w3c.dom.*</tt> 
packages, or other classes whose sole purpose is to implement 
these APIs.
